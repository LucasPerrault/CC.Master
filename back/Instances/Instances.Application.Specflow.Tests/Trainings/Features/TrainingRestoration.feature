Feature: Training restoration

Scenario: Restore a training instance by a user with no "RestoreInstances" operation
    Given a user with no operation 'RestoreInstances'
    When I request the training restoration of environment 'no-existing-training'
        Then user should get an error containing 'Operation(s) RestoreInstances is(are) missing'

Scenario: Restore a training instance by a user with no "ReadEnvironments" operation for the environment
    Given a user with department code 'DISTRIBUTOR'
    And user has operation 'ReadEnvironments' with scope 'OwnDistributorOnly' for purpose 'Contractual'
    And user has operation 'RestoreInstances' with scope 'OwnDistributorOnly' for purpose 'Contractual'
    When I request the training restoration of environment 'lucca-only-environment'
        Then user should get a not found exception

Scenario: Restore a training instance by a user with no "RestoreInstances" operation for the environment
    Given a user with department code 'DISTRIBUTOR'
    And user has operation 'ReadEnvironments' with scope 'AllDistributors' for purpose 'Contractual'
    And user has operation 'RestoreInstances' with scope 'OwnDistributorOnly' for purpose 'Contractual'
    When I request the training restoration of environment 'lucca-only-environment'
        Then user should get an error containing 'Insufficient rights to restore the training instance of this environment'

Scenario: Restore a training instance when there was already an active training instance
    Given a user with department code 'LUCCA'
    And user has operation 'ReadEnvironments' with scope 'AllDistributors' for purpose 'Contractual'
    And user has operation 'RestoreInstances' with scope 'AllDistributors' for purpose 'Contractual'
    When I request the training restoration of environment 'with-previous-active-training'
        Then the previous training instance should be marked as deleted
        And the previous training should be marked as inactive
        And a backup of the previous training database should be made
        And a training restoration entry should be created
        And a duplication of the production instance of the environment should be started

Scenario: Restore a training instance when there is no active training instance
    Given a user with department code 'LUCCA'
    And user has operation 'ReadEnvironments' with scope 'AllDistributors' for purpose 'Contractual'
    And user has operation 'RestoreInstances' with scope 'AllDistributors' for purpose 'Contractual'
    When I request the training restoration of environment 'with-no-active-training'
        Then we should not try to delete an instance
        And a backup of the previous training database should be made
        And a training restoration entry should be created
        And a duplication of the production instance of the environment should be started

Scenario Outline: Restore a training instance with different options are correctly recorded
    Given a user with department code 'LUCCA'
    And user has operation 'ReadEnvironments' with scope 'AllDistributors' for purpose 'Contractual'
    And user has operation 'RestoreInstances' with scope 'AllDistributors' for purpose 'Contractual'
    When I request the training restoration of environment 'with-no-active-training' <withOrWithoutAnonymisation> anonymisation, <withOrWithoutKeepingExistingPasswords> keeping existing passwords, <withOrWithoutRestoringFiles> restoring files and the comment is '<comment>' with the expiry date <commentExpiryDate>
        Then the training restoration object stores the correct values

    Examples:
            | withOrWithoutAnonymisation | withOrWithoutKeepingExistingPasswords | withOrWithoutRestoringFiles            | comment           | commentExpiryDate |

Scenario: Restore a training instance with no anonymisation should include only cleaning scripts
    Given a user with department code 'LUCCA'
    And user has operation 'ReadEnvironments' with scope 'AllDistributors' for purpose 'Contractual'
    And user has operation 'RestoreInstances' with scope 'AllDistributors' for purpose 'Contractual'
    When I request the training restoration of environment 'with-no-active-training' without anonymisation
    Then cleaning scripts should be applied
    And no anonymization scripts should be applied
    And no other scripts should be applied
